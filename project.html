            <div class="content">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p class="first">This is the server-side component of myflix movie app, developed using the MERN stack,<br> 
                that provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres.<br> 
                Users are able to create an account, update their personal data, and create a list of favorite movies.</p>
                <br />
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>I have built myFlix project as part of my full-stack immersion course at CareerFoundry,<br> 
                to demonstrate my mastery of full-stack JavaScript development.</p>
                <br />
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The aim of the project was to have an interactive and streamlined 
                web application where users can browse their favorite movies. </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Back-End</h2>
                <p>I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database & business logic (MongoDB & Mongoose).<br>
                The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data from and store data in the database, CRUD methods are used.<br>
                The API provides movie information in JSON format.<br>
                To test the API, I used Postman. I also included Passport & JWT to authenticate and authorize the users of the app.<br>
                And last but not least, I hosted the app's back-end API on Heroku.</p>
                <br />
                <br>
                <h2 class="myflix-title">React Front-End</h2>
                <a href="https://paulinemarg-myflix.netlify.app" target="_blank">
                <img class="myflix" src="images/myflix.png" alt="myflix screenshot">
                <img class="myflix" src="images/myflix2.png" alt="myflix screenshot"></a>
                <br>
                <p>Using React, I created seperate components for the different views of the application.<br>
                I implemented logic to handle app requests and navigate users to different views within the app, using React-Router-development.<br>
                Using Redux and React-Redux, I have managed the app's state and data flow by implementing the flux design pattern.<br>
                And finally, I hosted the app's front-end client on Netlify.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2 class="myflix-title">Angular Front-End</h2>
                <a href="https://paulinemarg.github.io/myFlix-Angular-client/" target="_blank">
                <img class="myflix" src="images/myflix4.png" alt="myflix screenshot">
                <img class="myflix" src="images/myflix5.png" alt="myflix screenshot"></a>
                <p>Using Angular, I created seperate components for different views of the application.<br>
                I used Angular material to design the app and Typedoc to comment.</p>
                <br />
                <h2><span class="note">Developer's-Notes<span></h2>
                <p>This was both my favorite & most challenging project, I was able to manage the technical complexity of backend,<br>
                create my own API and master the MERN stack. Though it wasn't smooth sailing, but persistancy, hard work and the support of my Mentor & Tutor<br>
                made it possible to conquer the obstacles.</p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>This is a serveless progressive web app that allows users to view upcoming events from an integrated Google Calendar.<br>
                    Users are able to sign in with their Google account and access the app offline</p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>I have built meet app project as part of my full-stack immersion course at CareerFoundry,<br>
                    to demonstrate my knowledge of both serverless architecture & PWAs.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Structure</h2>
                    <p>I decided to follow a test-driven development approach with this app and created test suites that included unit-testing,<br>
                    integration-testing, and end-to-end testing. I chose to use AWS as an authorization server and implement a serverless architecture.<br>
                    Google OAuth 2.0 is used to access the calendar API. The app passes Lighthouse PWA checklist and users are able to install the app on their browser or mobile home screen.<br>
                    I added data visualization to provide users with an easily readable representation of the frequency of the type and location of calendar events.</p>
                    <p>
                    <br />
                    <h2><span class="note">Developer's-Notes<span></h2>
                    <p>It was interesting working with serverless architecture, PWAs and applying TDD mindset.<br>
                    I found it very efficient the idea of testing-failing-coding-testing-passing-refactoring & repeat. </p>

                    <h2>Structure</h2>
                    <p>I implemented React Native along with Expo.io and Google Firestore to create a mobile chat application.<br>
                    I used Android Studio in order to view the app on an Android Virtual Device to manually view and test the app.<br>
                    Users are able exchange messages, images, and their location with help of the GiftedChat library.<br>
                    And the app authenticates users anonymously via Google Firebase authentication and users are able to access the app while offline.</p>
